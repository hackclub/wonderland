### Project Summary
We made a dino game where the dinosaur has to escape the hot sauce and collect ramen to get points. The images used are from the box we got!

### How did the items in your box inspire you?
We got a lot of random items so we decided to be playful with it and make a small video game. This was our first time creating a video game! (Check it out at https://1709f940-7d2b-4d40-b4f1-8cfb64802610-00-3blsee5ejugi4.janeway.replit.dev/)

### What items did you use?
- The dinosaur, our ramen, the hot sauce, and the picture of the dinosaur with the explosion in the background.
