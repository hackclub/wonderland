### Trade Record:

## End Result

### Ended With:

We ended up with a demo of a turret that could fairly accurately track and rotate to follow people as they moved around it's field of view.

The turret works well on the X-Axis, and more inconsistently when tracking objects vertically on the Y-Axis.

### Project Summary

A device that is able to position itself to track objects (like faces) using a laptop webcam.

### How did the items in your box inspire you?

The ProjeX Game had a very neat dual-motor control system that we were inspired to adapt to our project. The tomato served as a very useful target for debugging the visual system. The bug spray was subject to a lot of debate, but it gave us the idea to use the motors to track objects.
