# Chests
How would you combine a truck horn, simon says, Gorilla Glue and a tomatoe together? What about an air raid siren, a dinosaur, and a basketball?

That's what partipcants were asked when they found Wonderland's chests. An odd ball collection of toys, instruments, lights, plushies, and whatever the rabbits could get their hands on, these chests are the jumping off point for Wonderland's projects.

Check out the projects we made with out chests!
