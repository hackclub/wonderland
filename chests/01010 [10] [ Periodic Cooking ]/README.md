### Project Summary
We ended up making a Unity-based chemistry & cooking game which combined the food and the periodic tables. The game helped people strenghen their chemistry skills, forcing them to remember how chemical equations work in order to add the right ingredients.

This is far from what we started with - we initally had the idea of creating a hot-potato launcher system using the waffle iron, a spring, and a motor in which a person would catch the hot potato with a baseball glove if they lost the game.

We struggled with our inital idea due to time and hardware-resource contrsaints, but we generally agreed that it would be a good idea if there were no roadblocks.

### How did the items in your box inspire you?
I think our box was quite well put together and after only 5 minutes of recieving the box, we start brainstorming ideas of what to make with the items. People like french fries, and we had potatoes and a skillet, so we first came up with french-fry-centered ideas.

### What items did you use?
We mainly used the periodic tables, the potatos, the tomato, a fan motor, and the Clorox disinfecting wipes. It wasn't as many of the items as we hoped to use but we had fun with it.
