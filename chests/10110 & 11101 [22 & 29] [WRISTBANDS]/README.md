### Project Summary
We ended with an AI-generated version of Poetry for Neanderthals.

### How did the items in your box inspire you?
The game Poetry for Neanderthals inspired us to create an AI-generated version of that game. We used the wristbands to identify our team members, and the Febreze to create a refreshing environment.

### What items did you use?
- We used the toolbox, benadryl box, and wristbands, as well as the Febreze while we were brainstorming :)
