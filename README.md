# Wonderland

🕳️🐇 **How would you and your friends use a 🥕carrot in a hackathon project?**

How would you incorporate a ⌨️keyboard, a 🧸stuffed animal, and maybe a JS library that only gives you ASCII 🐄cow art?

That's what we figured out in Wonderland.

**In winter 2024, we limited ourselves to the fabled *chest*** 🧰: a mysterious mish-mash of tools, parts, and useless libraries. From the finitudes of this chest, come the infinities of Wonderland.

So, for forty-eight hours in the heart of Boston, you joined us down this rabbit hole. You found your parts, tools, and libraries to create something truly wonderful. 

This winter, I’m getting lost. Will you?
